**Version Coverage: v2.4.0 (Current Release)

This document provides a complete **User Requirements Specification (URS)**, **Functional Requirements Specification (FRS)**, and **Security Requirements Specification** for PlanIFlow, including detailed **Description** and **Acceptance Criteria** for each requirement. It incorporates all v2.4.0 features.

#### **1. User Requirements Specification (URS)**  
High-level needs from the end-user perspective.

| ID     | User Requirement                                      | Description                                                                                              | Acceptance Criteria                                                                                              |
|--------|-------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| URS-01 | Fully offline operation with local data storage       | The application must function completely without internet, storing all data locally.                    | Open and fully use the app on a machine with no network connection; all features work and data persists locally. |
| URS-02 | Intuitive task hierarchy and editing                   | Users need easy creation and organization of hierarchical tasks (WBS-style).                             | Create summary and sub-tasks, indent/outdent, edit inline without errors or confusion.                           |
| URS-03 | Visual Gantt with dependencies and critical path      | Clear visual representation of schedule, dependencies, and critical path is essential.                   | Gantt updates in real-time, shows dependency lines, highlights critical path correctly.                         |
| URS-04 | Resource allocation tracking with over-allocation alerts | Users must track resource usage and be warned of over-allocation.                                       | Assign resources to tasks, view utilization, receive warnings when daily hours exceed max.                       |
| URS-05 | Baseline tracking and variance analysis               | Ability to capture planned state and compare against actual progress (up to 11 baselines in v2.4.0).     | Create baselines, view color-coded variance in dates/duration/% complete.                                        |
| URS-06 | Monte Carlo simulation for risk forecasting           | Probabilistic forecasting of project completion dates.                                                   | Run simulation, view P50/P80/P90 dates, histogram, and top risk drivers.                                         |
| URS-07 | Earned Value Management (EVM) analysis                | Objective measurement of cost and schedule performance (new in v2.4.0).                                   | View PV/EV/AC, variances, indices (CPI/SPI), and forecasts (EAC/VAC) against selected baseline.                  |
| URS-08 | Global currency support with correct symbols          | Support for international users with accurate currency display and calculations (new in v2.4.0).         | Select currency in settings; correct symbol appears in resources, dashboard, exports.                           |
| URS-09 | Project-level custom holidays (including recurring)   | Define non-working periods that affect the entire project schedule, with recurring options (new in v2.4.0). | Add holidays/ranges with comments/recurring flag; task dates shift accordingly on recalculation.                 |
| URS-10 | Increased baseline capacity (up to 11)                | Support for more historical snapshots in longer projects (v2.4.0).                                       | Create up to 11 baselines; older files (≤3) load and allow additional baselines.                                |
| URS-11 | Modern, clean UI with space-efficient displays        | UI should be uncluttered, use abbreviations where sensible, with tooltips for clarity.                   | Short indicators (A/M), hover tooltips, full-screen default, repositioned buttons work as expected.               |
| URS-12 | Secure and reliable auto-updates                      | Users expect easy updates without security compromise.                                                   | Update check works; failures show generic error; successful updates install verified MSI.                        |
| URS-13 | Agile/Hybrid Visualization (Kanban Board)             | Visual task tracking by status with interactive editing (new in v2.4.0).                                 | Drag tasks between columns (To Do → In Progress); update notes/dates via clickable tiles; filter by task/resource.|
